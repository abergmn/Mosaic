# Mosaic

**Mosaic** is a source-available Python project designed for **network reconnaissance and mapping**. Its goal is to collect network intelligence and organize it into a clear, comprehensible view.  

> ⚠️ Currently in **proof-of-concept / development stage**. Use responsibly and only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

---

## Features (Current / Planned)
- **Port Scanning:** Scan a host or range of hosts to identify open TCP ports.  
- **Banner Grabbing:** Attempt to collect service banners from open ports.  
- **Network Discovery:** Identify live hosts in a subnet via ping sweeps.  
- **Data Mapping (Future):** Organize collected information into a structured network map.

## Installation
Mosaic is currently a simple Python project; no packaging is required.

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd mosaic
```

## Usage
Run Mosaic from the command line with the target host or subnet:  
```bash
python main.py --target <host_or_subnet>
```

## Responsible Use
Mosaic is a network reconnaissance tool. Unauthorized scanning or testing of systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and prohibited. Use responsibly.
